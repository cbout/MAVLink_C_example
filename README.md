# MAVLink_C_example #

This project is released by BERGOIN Raphäel and BOUT Clément, students in the University of Cergy-Pontoise. It contains some examples of our understanding of the MAVLink C library (refer to this [github project ](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v1) to see the entire MAVLink c library project).

## Introduction ##

As part of our studies, in the [Master 1 Computer sciences and engineering of complex systems (IISC)](https://depinfo.u-cergy.fr/master/m1-iisc-master-1), we work with the [ETIS](https://www-etis.ensea.fr/) laboratory to release a stable commucation between a 3DR Solo and C programme wich can control it.

We have decided to use the [c_library_v1](https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v1) and we do not find many examples of implementation. That is why we are going to expose our understanding of the MAVLink communication and the C library across some examples in the folder examples.
